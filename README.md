# 👋 Hi, I'm Leopold

I build systems that simplify and optimize complex processes through code and computation.  
I work on independent projects exploring algorithms, modeling systems, and testing ideas in practice.

Some areas I focus on:

- Algorithms and data structures, implementing and optimizing classical and modern methods
- Systems and automation: building tools to streamline workflows and experiments
- Numerical and scientific computing: analyzing data, running simulations, visualizing results
- Code-driven experiments: testing heuristics, AI methods, and computational ideas
- Dev tooling and productivity: CLI tools, scripts, and lightweight APIs
